        <!-- start of Sherlock Holmes story -->
        <article id="story" class="story">

            <p class="dropcap">Today in this essay I will talk about why did I choose EMT(Emergency medical technician) to do volunteer. I volunteered at the Somerset County Training Academy.It is not an easy task to be an EMT because other people's lives depend on you and your training. It is not about driving the car 90mph and also it is not about driving with your car sirens on as cool as it is it needs to be for the right reasons and need to be very careful even when responding to call because you can harm yourself and your partner if you don't be careful. Law enforcement officers are usually the first ones to the scene who are able to help in little way because they know basic life saving skills but as an EMT knows so much more because it's his job. A step above an EMT's paramedics who are allowed to further treat the patient then an EMT they are allowed to poke needles and so much more were an EMT is not allowed to. It’s about how to save someone life and how to help others when they need it. There are calls that keep coming 24/7 when someone need medical attention. They also teach how to give CPR as basic as possible that the first step to being an EMT. I had learned that in the high school but I never went in the ambulance to save someone's life or to even just transport them. After High School i got my basic life certificate and decided to ride with a rescue squad so i can make a difference in my community and give back to the people. An EMT also teaches you how to use equipment such as oxygen tank lights and sirens a CPR mask and a stethoscope. One thing I have learned from my experience riding with a rescue squad is you have to be very fast whenever someone calls 911 you have to get read and leave as soon as possible and be prepared for what's to come. An EMT makes about 42,000 dollars a year. Although they don't make much they don't do it for the money they do it in support of their communities and to help people in a way most people can't. </p>

            <p>Day 1: Today is the day where I am volunteer at somerset academy to learn how to save someone life. On the first day we learned how to give CPR. the first step to give CPR is to place your right hand over the center of the patient chest then place left hand over the right hand and press down and start compression. You must do 100 compressions then tilt the head back and breath into his mouth to provide the patient some oxygen and clear the breathing path. The reason you provide CPR is the when the patient past out and does not have a pulse which mean the heart has stopped beating. CPR will help manually make the beat again and bring the patient back to life. Then when the defibrator arrive you must place the first patch over the right chest and then second on bottom left of the ribs. Then you must clear the area around you and get ready for shock then when the machine says clear you must press the button and shock the patient and if the patient is still not responsive you must continue with CPR. Until the paramedic show up and declare his time of death. The next thing we learn how to use a oxygen tank when the patient says they feeling shortness of the breath you provide them with oxygen coming from the oxygen tank. You put the mask on the patient and help them to breath at a regular pace. Oxygen tank provides the most natural and clean air. The 2 hours we have left we had lecture on the heart works and he also teach us that all we have learn we going to have test on them. So he said we better learn everything good. 

            </p>
            <p>In the day 2 we start doing rig check it’s take around 2 hours to check then we waited for emergency medical call to response to. When the person call 911 it goes to dispatcher then the dispatcher put it through to the EMT the building alarm goes off then the crew immediately gets ready and then gets in the ambulance turn on light and siren then rush to the call. Assess the situation and treat the patient accordingly. Today I response to the call the patient was unconscious he was older gentleman who fell down the stair and past out. When we got there the patient was already awake because of the police officer who helped him. He had the option to go to the hospital if he wanted because he was still bleeding in his head. Then patient said yes then we all helped him to put him in the ambulance and way to hospital we were checking the patient about everything. Then the doctor put the patch on his head were he was bleeding by doing that blood can stop like temporary. Then by the time we get in the hospital we all rush into the ER. Then I and my group came back to the headquarter. I just realized how fast we have to be to get the madic to the people who need it. 

            </p>
            
            <p>In my 3 day of the service learning, I continue to respond to calls. I was very excited to actually helping EMT and get hands on the experience. I just want to get in the ambulance and help again which makes me so proud that I can do that all the time in my free time. Suddenly I heard a call that lady need helps that she overdose drug and she need to go to the hospital as soon as possible. Then we rushed into our truck and then the driver put the siren and lights on. That makes me proud that we going for saving someone life. When we get to the her house she was throwing up and she also told one of our member that she feel dizzy too. So put her in the ambulance as soon as possible. So her family guy was riding with us just in case something happens way to the hospital. We all went in with the patent in the ER and the doctors and nurse was already for the patent. Then the day was almost over then we all went to eat somewhere.  After the lunch that I ate it with the bravo then my shift was over then I went home. I took some rest in my bed time I was thinking that I saved someone's life today. It's really good for me that I never saved someone's life that's good for me. 
            </p>
            
            <p>In the day 4 it’s a sunday which mean clean day but we still responds to the call though. So we have to clean all the stuff and put all the equipment where they belongs. We also fill all the stuff such as gloves mask like everything they use it in the ambulance. We have to clean all the stuff. Then after we did everything that then we have lecture. In the lecture they explained to us how to use the radio and the how to use and why to use the lights and sirens of an ambulance. Also taught us basic skills such as how to take off gloves and when to wear masks and etc… From the EMT job i realized it's really hard but an honorable career.

            <p>I wished myself a hundred miles off. He repeated his question, "What is his name?"</p>
